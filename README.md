- **CA Intermediate** from The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, India (GPA: 3.6)
- **Bachelor of Commerce** ‚Äì Accounting, Finance, and Taxation from Gujarat University, India

üë®‚Äçüíª **Professional Experience:**

**Artificial Intelligence Engineer Intern**  
*RadicalX, New York* | June 2023 ‚Äì Aug 2023  
- Advocated for open-source models to uphold data privacy standards, ensuring ethical AI development.
- Implemented FAISS for managing high-dimensional vector databases, improving data retrieval efficiency by 40%.
- Developed an AI system using the OpenAI API, enhancing information retrieval and user interaction.
- Improved question-answer formats, boosting accuracy and reducing errors by 40% and 25%.
- Conducted a comparative performance analysis between BERT and LLama2 models, showcasing LLama2's superiority.

üöÄ **Project Experience:**

- **Code Translator App:** Developed a robust application capable of translating code between various programming languages (Python, Java, C++, etc.) as well as handling different databases (SQL, NoSQL). The app supports code conversion for multiple use cases such as function-based, object-oriented, and database-related code snippets. It utilizes large language models (LLMs) like Groq, OpenAI, and Llama3 for accurate translations. It also supports floating-point formats (FP16, FP32, bfloat16) and includes automatic handling of bash scripts, command-line utilities, and configuration files for seamless integration with different environments.
